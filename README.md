# PlantsDatabase
Database of Information on Android Application

We are creating an application that takes a CSV file that we have scraped and turns that into SQL database objects offline.

We currently have an example (see the screenshots folder, or build android project) that has a sample of what our CSV data would look like. Given the size of our data set, we may eventually choose to move the project online and then connect to a remote server rather than creating and storing the database locally, but currently our project is offline.


See PlantsDatabase/app/src/main/java/com/example/achndrs4/plantme/DBHandler.java code for information on how we made the database
